This is a post with executable code.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

height <- c(1.50, 1.55, 1.63, 1.68)
age <- c(12, 15, 20, 40)

df <- data.frame(height, age)

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = height)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()


```

```{python}
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

height = [1.50, 1.55, 1.63, 1.68]
age = [12, 15, 20, 40]

d = {
  'height': height,
  'age': age
}

df = pd.DataFrame(d)

sns \
.scatterplot(
  data = d,
  x = 'age',
  y = 'height'
)

plt.show()


```

In my case, I learnt R before learning Python. There isn't really a better or worse language. I learnt R and it was addictive.. I made a job-switch and colleagues are coding in Python, hence I need to be fluent enough in it...
